GENERAL INFO-------------------------------------
This program aims to make a list for products.
NorthwindContext was used in this program. 
It includes CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations.

BUGS AND OTHER ISSUES---------------------------- 
Some products related with database can't remove. But if you add new product, you can remove it. I don't know how to handle this issue. 
The exception is: System.Data.Entity.Infrastructure.DbUpdateException: 'An error occurred while updating the entries. See the inner exception for details.'
